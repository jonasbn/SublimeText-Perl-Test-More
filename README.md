SublimeText-Perl-Test-More
==========================

This package provides snippets for Perl's [Test::More](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::More) for [Sublime Text 2/3](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

# Introduction and Usage

The package is currently offering the following snippets:

```perl
BAIL_OUT
can_ok
cmp_ok
diag
is
isa_ok
isnt
like
ok
unlike
is_deeply
done_testing
```

So you simply write the [Test::More](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::More) routine you want and press the tab key

An example:

```perl
ok<tab>
```

expands to:

```perl
ok($got eq $expected, 'test_name');
```

1. tabbing again lets you write the assertion
2. tabbing yet again lets you label the test
3. And then you can run your test suite

This package can with luck be used with the [package](https://github.com/jonasbn/SublimeText-Perl-Test-Class) for Perl's [Test::Class](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Class) for Sublime Text 2/3.

# Installation

Several options are available for installation.

## Via Sublime Package Control:

- `Control`+`Shift`+`P` on Linux/Windows,
- `Command`+`Shift`+`P` on OS X,
- or for any OS
  1. Select `Tools->Command Palette` from the menu
  2. Select `Package Control: Install Package`
  3. Select **perl-Test-More** from the list of available packages

## Git:

Clone the repository in your Sublime Text Packages directory.

```git clone https://github.com/jonasbn/perl-Sublime-Test-More```

The advantage of using either Package Control or git is, that the plugin will be automatically kept _up-to-date_.

# Motivation

I write a lot of test code across projects/distributions and since [Test::More](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::More) is put to such wide use it is nice to be able to write tests fast and consistenly.
